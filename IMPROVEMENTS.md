## Overview
This enhanced version of the Texas Hold'em poker game for Flipper Zero includes significant improvements to AI, game mechanics, and user interface based on modern poker strategy and player experience.

## Major Improvements Implemented

### 1. Advanced AI System

#### AI Player Structure Enhancements
- **Opponent Modeling**: AI tracks other players' aggression patterns and adapts strategy accordingly

- **Risk Tolerance**: Each AI has individual risk tolerance affecting all-in decisions
- **Hand Tracking**: AI tracks hands played and won for statistical adaptation
- **Experience Learning**: AI adjusts behavior based on observed opponent patterns

#### AI Personalities Enhanced
1. **Conservative AI (Easy)**
   - Aggression: 0.3, Bluff Rate: 0.1
   - High position awareness, low risk tolerance
   - Cautious against aggressive opponents

2. **Aggressive AI (Medium)**
   - Aggression: 0.7, Bluff Rate: 0.3
   - Maximum position awareness, high risk tolerance
   - Less affected by opponent aggression

3. **Balanced AI (Medium)**
   - Aggression: 0.5, Bluff Rate: 0.2
   - Moderate position awareness and risk tolerance
   - Incorporates randomness for unpredictability

#### Advanced Decision Making
